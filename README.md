# AI-Driven Voice and Chat Assistant Web Application

## Project Overview

This is a comprehensive AI-powered voice and chat assistant application that allows users to interact with both a chatbot and a voice assistant. Built using **React** for the frontend and **Node.js** with **Express** for the backend, this application integrates the **Google Generative AI** (Gemini) API to provide intelligent responses. It leverages speech synthesis and speech recognition APIs to enable seamless interaction through both voice and text. The application is fully responsive, ensuring a great user experience across various devices.
